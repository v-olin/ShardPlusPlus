## Shard++
The project is about rewriting the game-engine "Shard" supplied in the course "TDA572 / DIT572 Game engine architecture" from C# to C++
and extending it with new features.

**Some features:**
- Physically based rendering (PBR) with IBL
- Enviroment mapping
- 3D model loading with materials that can be used for physically-based rendering (PBR)
- AABBs for game objects
- Sweep and prune (SAP) collision detection in 3D
- Eventlisteners for game objects (e.g. OnCollisionEnter, OnCollisionStay, OnCollisionExit)
- Flight controls (pitch, yaw, roll) for the player
- First person camera, third person camera, follow-cam
- Possible to set your own shader
- Ray-object collision testing (e.g. clicking on an object on your screen)
- Heightfields and procedurally generated terrain.
- Pathtracing.
- Variable refreshrate runtime
- Physics works the same no matter the framerate
